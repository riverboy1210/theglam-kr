# THE GLAM Article Transformation Pipeline

## Objective
- Convert legacy copied/AI-like text into female-focused, high-intent beauty/clinic decision content.
- Keep legal safety: no verbatim copy, no fabricated testimonials, no misleading claims.
- Funnel intent users to platform cross-check (Babitalk/GangnamUnni) and final clinic contact action.

## Audience
- Women in their 20s-30s (primary), 40s (secondary)
- High-interest topics: price, side effects, recovery, clinic choice
- Decision stage: pre-consultation and comparison

## Content Types (must classify before rewrite)
1. `PRICE` - quote, package, hidden fee, event terms
2. `SAFETY` - side effects, emergency signs, contraindication
3. `RECOVERY` - timeline, daily life return, care protocol
4. `CLINIC_CHOICE` - review reading, consult questions, comparison rules

## Mandatory Output Structure (for every article)
1. Search Intent Summary (3 bullets)
2. Title candidates (5)
3. SEO title / meta / slug
4. Main content (H1 + 3 to 5 H2 sections)
5. FAQ (6)
6. CTA block (2 links minimum)
7. Safety disclaimer block

## Conversion Flow Rules
- Hook (pain/risk) -> Value (checklist/table) -> Trust (FAQ/disclaimer) -> Action (CTA)
- At least one neutral cross-check CTA:
  - `https://www.babitalk.com/`
  - `https://www.gangnamunni.com/`
- At least one direct action CTA:
  - call: `tel:0233333539`
  - email: `mailto:hello@theglam.kr`

## Review/Comment Handling Policy (critical)
- Do NOT copy review text verbatim.
- Do NOT keep personal identifiers (nickname, timestamp, photo, contact).
- Do NOT fabricate positive comments.
- Allowed: summarize repeated themes as "pattern insight".
- Required disclaimer example:
  - "본 내용은 외부 공개 후기의 공통 패턴을 재정리한 요약 정보이며, 원문은 각 플랫폼에서 직접 확인하세요."

## AI-tone Removal Checklist
- Shorten sentence length; remove repetitive abstract wording
- Add concrete criteria and checklists
- Replace generic praise with decision logic
- Add "what to do now" action sentence in conclusion

## Batch Operation
- Batch size: 20 articles
- QA pass after each batch:
  1) legal phrasing check
  2) SEO placement check
  3) readability check
  4) conversion link check
